* Company (Dollar, etc)
* Color (black, red, etc)
* Refillable (Boolean- either it’s refillable or not)
* Ink status(Boolean- ink empty or not)

2. A method to refill the board marker. The method should first check if the marker is refillable or not, then display an appropriate message.

Demonstrate your class by creating an object, setting the values and then calling the functions.

## Question # 02

**Create a class called water bottle.**\
The water bottle has a company (made by), color and water capacity. The water capacity isstored in both liters(l) and milliliters(ml).

Create variables and methods for your class. Methods should include getters and setters.
Also create an additional method that updates the water capacity (both in l and ml) after asking user how
much water a person has drank. Assume that the user always enters the amount in ml.

Demonstrate the functionality of the water bottle in your main method.

2. Remove a task. Accepts the date and month as a parameter to remove the task from.
3. Show tasks. This method should go through all of your months and print all the tasks allocated.

Your task is to create one calendar object, then hardcode 5-6 tasks for your calendar. Then demonstrate how you’ll remove a task, and display the updated task list.

## Question # 04
